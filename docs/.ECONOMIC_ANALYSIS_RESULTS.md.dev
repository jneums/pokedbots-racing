# Economic Analysis Results - December 2025

## Executive Summary

**Player Report Validation:** ✅ CONFIRMED
- Maintenance costs of 0.65 ICP per 12hr window are accurate for aggressive racing (3-4 races/bot/window)
- ~6 ICP weekly prizes indicate either low win rates or lower-tier class racing
- **Critical Finding:** When entry fees are included, current strategy may be unprofitable

## Current State Analysis

### Player Scenario (5-6 Bots, Aggressive Racing)

**Reported Metrics:**
- Bots: 5-6
- Maintenance: 0.65 ICP per 12hr window
- Weekly Prizes: ~6 ICP
- Implied Racing Volume: ~105 races/week (~3 races/bot/day × 5 bots × 7 days)

**Important Context:** 
- Only 4 Daily Sprint events per day (every 6 hours)
- Maximum 4 races/day/bot (one per event)
- Realistic with maintenance: 2-3 races/day/bot

**Complete Financial Picture:**
```
Revenue (Prizes):        6.00 ICP/week
Entry Fees:            -15.75 ICP/week  (105 races × ~0.15 avg)
Maintenance:            -1.75 ICP/week  (~0.35 ICP/bot/week × 5 bots)
────────────────────────────────────────
NET RESULT:           -11.50 ICP/week ⚠️
```

**Analysis:** The player is likely only counting prizes as "rewards" without factoring in entry fees as costs. The reported 0.65 ICP per 12hr window seems high for only 3 races/day - may indicate they're doing repairs/recharges more frequently than needed, or have additional bots beyond the 5 racing actively.

## Simulation Results

### Scenario Comparison (7-Day Simulations)

| Strategy | Net Profit | ROI | Hourly Rate | Optimal For |
|----------|-----------|-----|-------------|-------------|
| **Single Elite Bot** (6 races/day) | **21.62 ICP** | **101%** | **0.129 ICP/hr** | Competitive players with 1 strong bot |
| **5-Bot Mixed** (3 racers + 2 scavengers) | 16.87 ICP | 60% | 0.100 ICP/hr | Players with diverse roster |
| **Two-Bot Rotation** | 6.26 ICP | 45% | 0.037 ICP/hr | Conservative strategy |
| **Budget 2-Bot** (Scavenger/Raider) | 2.51 ICP | 53% | 0.015 ICP/hr | Entry-level players |

### Key Findings

1. **Elite-class racing is significantly more profitable** than lower tiers
   - Single elite bot: 21.62 ICP/week vs 2.51 ICP for budget strategy
   - Higher entry fees are offset by much better prize pools
   
2. **Quality > Quantity**
   - 1 elite bot outperforms 5 lower-tier bots
   - Maintenance scales linearly with bot count
   - Win rate matters more than race volume

3. **Platform bonuses are critical** for lower-tier profitability
   - Scavenger/Raider classes depend on Daily Sprint bonuses (0.5 ICP)
   - Elite/SilentKlan classes are self-sustaining

## Break-Even Analysis

### Required Top-3 Finish Rates by Class

| Class | Entry Fee | Maintenance/Race | Total Cost | Avg Prize (Top 3) | **Break-Even Rate** |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Scavenger | 0.05 ICP | 0.029 ICP | 0.079 ICP | 0.15 ICP | **53%** |
| Raider | 0.10 ICP | 0.029 ICP | 0.129 ICP | 0.30 ICP | **43%** |
| Elite | 0.25 ICP | 0.029 ICP | 0.279 ICP | 0.80 ICP | **35%** ⭐ |
| SilentKlan | 0.50 ICP | 0.029 ICP | 0.529 ICP | 1.50 ICP | **35%** ⭐ |

**Insight:** Elite and SilentKlan classes have LOWER break-even thresholds despite higher entry fees. This makes them more profitable for skilled players.

## Power Core Economics

### Battery Drain by Power Core Level

| Power Core | Battery Drain % | Races per Recharge | Cost per Race | Savings vs PC=50 |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|------------------|
| 30 | 48.3% | 10.4 | 0.0097 ICP | -20% |
| 50 | 40.5% | 12.3 | 0.0081 ICP | baseline |
| 70 | 35.4% | 14.1 | 0.0071 ICP | **+12%** ⭐ |
| 80 | 33.4% | 15.0 | 0.0067 ICP | **+17%** |
| 100 | 30.0% | 16.7 | 0.0060 ICP | **+26%** |

### Upgrade ROI Analysis

**Scenario:** 28 races/week (4 races/day)

| Upgrade Path | Upgrade Cost | Weekly Savings | Weeks to ROI | Recommendation |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| PC 50 → 60 | 40 ICP | 0.016 ICP | 2,577 weeks | ❌ Not worth it |
| PC 50 → 70 | 80 ICP | 0.029 ICP | 2,793 weeks | ⚠️ Long-term only |
| PC 50 → 80 | 140 ICP | 0.040 ICP | 3,499 weeks | ⚠️ Very long-term |

**Note:** The ROI periods are extremely long because maintenance costs are already quite low relative to entry fees. Power Core upgrades provide marginal savings compared to the strategic optimizations below.

## Optimization Strategies

### Immediate Actions (No Cost)

1. **Reduce Racing Frequency**
   - Current: 6 races/bot/day (aggressive)
   - Target: 4 races/bot/day (sustainable)
   - Savings: ~35% reduction in maintenance
   - Trade-off: Fewer total prizes, but better ROI

2. **Strategic Race Selection**
   - Prioritize races with platform bonuses (Daily Sprints)
   - Target Elite-class races (better prize-to-cost ratio)
   - Avoid racing when battery < 60% (performance penalties)
   - Time races around cooldowns (recharge: 6hr, repair: 3hr)

3. **Bot Rotation Schedule**
   ```
   Window 1 (0-6hr):   Bots A, B race | Bots C, D rest
   Window 2 (6-12hr):  Bots C, D race | Bots A, B rest
   Window 3 (12-18hr): Bots A, B race | Bots C, D rest
   Window 4 (18-24hr): Bots C, D race | Bots A, B rest
   ```
   - Maximizes cooldown efficiency
   - Reduces simultaneous maintenance costs

### Medium-Term Actions (Moderate Cost)

4. **Focus Your Roster**
   - Current: 5-6 bots racing simultaneously
   - Target: 2-3 elite bots in rotation
   - Benefits:
     - Better win rates per bot
     - Lower total maintenance
     - Higher prizes per race

5. **Upgrade to Elite Class**
   - Invest in getting bots to 6+ wins (Elite tier)
   - Elite races have better economics than Scavenger/Raider
   - Break-even threshold: 35% vs 43-53% for lower tiers

### Long-Term Actions (High Cost, High ROI)

6. **Strategic Stat Upgrades**
   - Priority 1: **Speed & Acceleration** (improve win rate)
   - Priority 2: **Stability** (consistency)
   - Priority 3: Power Core (maintenance reduction - marginal)
   
7. **Scavenging Integration**
   - Use 1-2 bots for scavenging missions
   - Generates passive parts income
   - Reduces upgrade costs over time

## Recommended Strategies by Player Profile

## Conclusion

**The current economic model is VIABLE but requires active optimization.**

Key Takeaways:
- ✅ Profitable with proper strategy (20+ ICP/week possible)
- ⚠️ Unprofitable with naive play (volume without optimization)
- 🎯 Sweet spot: 2-3 elite bots, 3-4 races/day (attend 3-4 of 4 daily events), strategic timing
- 💡 Focus on win rate > race volume
- 📊 Elite/SilentKlan classes offer best economics
- 🕐 Race schedule: 4 events daily at 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00 UTC

**Player Scenario Analysis:**
The player with 5-6 bots earning 6 ICP/week is losing ~11.5 ICP/week when entry fees and maintenance are properly accounted for. With only 4 race events per day, they're averaging 3 races/bot/day across 5 bots (15 races/day).

**Primary Issues:**
1. Racing in low-tier classes (Scavenger/Raider) with poor prize/cost ratios
2. Low win rate (6 ICP from 105 races = 0.057 ICP/race average)
3. Possibly over-maintaining (0.65 ICP per 12hr seems high for 6-8 races)

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Focus on 2-3 best bots instead of 5-6
2. Upgrade to Elite class (better economics)
3. Improve win rate through stat upgrades
4. Reduce unnecessary maintenance (don't repair/recharge unless needed)
