# Economic Rebalancing Recommendations

## Executive Summary

**Current State:** The system is **highly profitable** when scavenging is included (~20-50 ICP/week possible), but players **perceive** maintenance costs as too high because they don't see the full picture of their earnings.

**Core Issues:**
1. **Perception Problem:** Players focus on racing costs without accounting for scavenging income
2. **Scavenging is TOO profitable:** 50+ ICP/week passive income with zero skill
3. **Maintenance costs feel expensive** relative to individual race prizes
4. **Information asymmetry:** Players don't see total net income clearly

## Problem Analysis

### Current Economics (With Scavenging)

| Strategy | Racing NET | Scavenging NET | Total NET | Time Investment |
|----------|-----------|----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **5 bots scavenging only** | 0 ICP | +54 ICP/week | **+54 ICP/week** | 10 min/day (passive) |
| **3 racers + 3 scavengers** | -4.5 ICP | +32 ICP/week | **+28 ICP/week** | 1-2 hr/day |
| **1 elite racer + 4 scavengers** | +5 ICP | +43 ICP/week | **+48 ICP/week** | 1 hr/day |

### The Problems

**1. Scavenging Dominates Everything**
- Pure scavenging: 54 ICP/week, zero skill, 10 min/day
- Racing struggles to compete unless you're elite-tier
- No incentive to improve at racing

**2. Maintenance Costs Feel Bad**
- 0.1 ICP recharge vs 0.15 ICP average Scavenger race prize
- Players see individual transactions, not aggregate profit
- "I just paid 0.1 ICP to earn 0.05 ICP" feels terrible
- Loss aversion bias makes costs feel worse than they are

**3. Information Asymmetry**
- No dashboard showing total earnings (racing + scavenging + parts value)
- Parts income is "invisible" until converted to ICP
- Players undervalue passive income

## Recommended Solutions

### TIER 1: Immediate UX Fixes (No Balance Changes)

#### 1. Comprehensive Economics Dashboard
**Implementation:** Add to bot garage UI

```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Impact:** Players see full picture, understand profitability

#### 2. Contextual Pricing Display
**Change transaction messages from:**
```
"Recharge cost: 0.1 ICP"
```

**To:**
```
"Recharge: 0.1 ICP (enables 5-7 races worth 0.5-1.5 ICP)"
```

**Impact:** Frames maintenance as investment, not expense

#### 3. Parts Value Visibility
**Show ICP value everywhere parts appear:**
```
Parts Inventory:
  Speed Chips: 127 (≈1.27 ICP)
  Universal Parts: 89 (≈0.89 ICP)
  ──────────────────────────
  Total Value: ≈4.52 ICP
```

**Impact:** Players see scavenging as real income

---

### TIER 2: Moderate Balance Adjustments

#### 4. Reduce Maintenance Costs (20-30%)

**Option A: Reduce Base Costs**
```
Recharge: 0.1 → 0.075 ICP (-25%)
Repair: 0.05 → 0.04 ICP (-20%)
```

**Option B: Increase Restoration Amounts**
```
Recharge: 75 → 90 battery (+20%)
Repair: 25 → 30 condition (+20%)
```

**Option C: Hybrid**
```
Recharge: 0.1 → 0.08 ICP, 75 → 85 battery
Repair: 0.05 → 0.04 ICP, 25 → 28 condition
```

**Recommendation:** **Option B** - Keeps nominal prices but improves value
- Psychological: "0.1 ICP" feels like a round number
- Better value per transaction
- Enables more races per maintenance cycle

**Impact:**
- Maintenance costs: 3.74 → 3.12 ICP/week (-17%)
- Net profit: 28.09 → 28.71 ICP/week
- **Feels better without breaking economy**

#### 5. Nerf Scavenging Returns (15-25%)

**Problem:** 54 ICP/week passive is too high

**Solution A: Reduce Parts Multipliers**
```
DeadMachineFields: 2.0x → 1.6x parts (-20%)
AbandonedSettlements: 1.4x → 1.2x parts (-15%)
ScrapHeaps: 1.0x (unchanged - safe zone)
```

**Solution B: Reduce Base Parts**
```
WastelandExpedition: 100-200 → 80-160 parts (-20%)
DeepSalvage: 40-80 → 35-70 parts (-15%)
ShortExpedition: 15-35 → 15-30 parts (minimal change)
```

**Solution C: Increase Battery Costs**
```
WastelandExpedition: 80 → 100 battery (+25%)
DeepSalvage: 40 → 50 battery (+25%)
ShortExpedition: 20 → 25 battery (+25%)
```

**Recommendation:** **Combine A + C**
- Reduce dangerous zone multipliers 15-20%
- Increase battery costs 20%
- Net effect: ~30% reduction in scavenging profit
- Still profitable, just not overwhelming

**Impact:**
- Pure scavenging: 54 → ~38 ICP/week (still excellent!)
- Mixed strategy: 28 → ~22 ICP/week (healthy)
- Racing becomes relatively more valuable

---

### TIER 3: Structural Changes (Long-term)

#### 6. Tiered Maintenance Pricing

**Concept:** Scale costs with bot tier/wins

```
Scavenger Class (0-2 wins):
  Recharge: 0.06 ICP
  Repair: 0.03 ICP

Raider Class (3-5 wins):
  Recharge: 0.08 ICP
  Repair: 0.04 ICP

Elite Class (6-9 wins):
  Recharge: 0.10 ICP
  Repair: 0.05 ICP

SilentKlan Class (10+ wins):
  Recharge: 0.12 ICP
  Repair: 0.06 ICP
```

**Rationale:**
- New players pay less, reducing barrier to entry
- Elite bots earn more, can afford higher costs
- Matches prize pool progression

**Impact:**
- Better new player experience
- Elite players unaffected (already profitable)
- Natural progression curve

#### 7. Maintenance Subscription Model

**Concept:** Optional weekly subscription for unlimited maintenance

```
Basic Plan: 1.5 ICP/week
  • Unlimited recharges
  • Unlimited repairs
  • 1-2 bots

Standard Plan: 3.5 ICP/week
  • Unlimited recharges
  • Unlimited repairs
  • 3-5 bots

Premium Plan: 6 ICP/week
  • Unlimited recharges
  • Unlimited repairs
  • Unlimited bots
  • Priority race entry
```

**Rationale:**
- Predictable costs (players love certainty)
- Heavy users save money
- Platform gets stable revenue
- Removes "death by a thousand cuts" feeling

**Impact:**
- 5-bot racer paying 3.74 ICP/week → saves money on Standard
- Better UX (no micro-transactions)
- Premium feels like value-add

#### 8. Parts-Based Maintenance

**Concept:** Allow paying for maintenance with parts instead of ICP

```
Recharge Options:
  • 0.075 ICP
  • 10 Power Core Fragments
  • 10 Universal Parts

Repair Options:
  • 0.04 ICP
  • 8 Any specific parts
  • 8 Universal Parts
```

**Rationale:**
- Scavengers can self-sustain (parts → maintenance)
- Creates parts sink (reduces inflation)
- Gives players choice
- Parts feel "free" (sunk cost fallacy works in our favor)

**Impact:**
- Scavengers feel more self-sufficient
- Parts have utility beyond upgrades
- Psychological win (paying with found parts vs ICP)
