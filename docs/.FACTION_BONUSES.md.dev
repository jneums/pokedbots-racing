# Faction Bonuses - Complete Reference

## Overview
All 14 PokedBots factions have unique characteristics based on their rarity tier and Type trait from the NFT collection. Factions are automatically derived from trait combinations during stat generation and determine upgrade efficiency, decay rates, and potential future bonuses.

**Current Implementation Status:**
- ✅ **Faction assignment**: Based on Type trait from NFT metadata
- ✅ **Upgrade bonus mechanics**: Catch-up system - rarer factions have LOWER bonus chance (common/rare get better odds)
- ✅ **Decay rates**: Rarity-based faster recharge (ultra-rare recharge faster)
- ✅ **Racing terrain bonuses**: Blackhole (+12% MetalRoads), Box (+10% ScrapHeaps), Game (+8% WastelandSand), Golden (+15% at 90%+ condition)
- ✅ **Preferred terrain bonus**: +5% all stats when racing on bot's preferred terrain
- 🔜 **Scavenging bonuses**: Designed but not yet implemented (see below for planned mechanics)

## Design Philosophy

1. **Rarity ≠ Power:** Common bots can compete with proper upgrades - rarity affects efficiency, not ceiling
2. **Terrain Specialization:** Factions excel in specific environments (Blackhole on MetalRoads, Box on ScrapHeaps, etc.)
3. **Maintenance Matters:** Golden's condition requirement creates interesting trade-offs
4. **Future-Proof:** Scavenging bonuses designed to expand faction identity without breaking racing balance
5. **Flavor First:** Mechanics match thematic identity (Blackhole = void energy, Golden = pristine, Dead = undying)

---

## Future Expansions (Planned)

**When Scavenging Launches:**
- Implement all planned scavenging bonuses
- Add faction-specific zones or events
- Create faction reputation/loyalty tracking
- Faction-exclusive scavenging tools or upgrades

**Potential Future Features:**
- Faction tournaments (Bee vs Animal, etc.)
- Cross-faction alliances/rivalries for team races
- Faction cosmetic variants (e.g., "Void-touched" Blackhole variants)
- Faction-specific achievement systems
- Dynamic faction balance patches based on usage data
