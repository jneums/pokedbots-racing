# Cross-Collection Scrap System

## Overview
Burn/lock NFTs from other IC collections to receive PokedBot upgrade parts. Creates utility for dead projects and cross-ecosystem value flow.

## Flow
1. **User scraps NFT** → Transfers to canister scrapyard subaccount
2. **System mints parts** → Based on NFT's collection tier/floor price
3. **User crafts upgrades** → Combine parts into stat boosts

## Part Types
- **Speed Chip** → Velocity upgrades
- **Power Core** → PowerCore upgrades  
- **Thruster Kit** → Thruster upgrades
- **Gyro Module** → Gyro upgrades
- **Universal Part** → Any upgrade type

## Scrap Values (Example)
```
ICPunks (floor ~100 ICP)     → 10 Universal Parts
MotokoDayDrop (floor ~5 ICP) → 1-2 Random Parts
Unknown collection           → 1 Universal Part (base)
```

## Crafting Recipes
```
3 Speed Chips      → Velocity Upgrade (+3-5 speed)
3 Power Cores      → PowerCore Upgrade (+3-5 power)
3 Thruster Kits    → Thruster Upgrade (+3-5 accel)
3 Gyro Modules     → Gyro Upgrade (+1-3 stability)
5 Universal Parts  → Any upgrade of choice
10 Universal Parts → Prestige specialization unlock
```

## Benefits
- ✅ Gives utility to dead NFT projects
- ✅ Creates arbitrage (cheap NFTs → expensive upgrades)
- ✅ Marketing across IC NFT communities
- ✅ Deflationary for participating collections
- ✅ Alternative to direct ICP upgrades

## Optional Features
- **Collection Affinity**: Scrapped NFT type influences part effectiveness
- **Parts Marketplace**: Trade parts between players
- **Scrapyard Auction**: Periodically auction scrapped NFTs for ICP → prize pools
- **Leaderboards**: Track total value scrapped, "Wasteland Recycler" achievements
