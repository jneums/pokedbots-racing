## The World of PokedBots

### Year 2525 AD

Humans have long abandoned Earth, leaving only robots to inhabit the ruins. In the eastern wastelands, centered around the mysterious **Delta City**, various factions of robots have developed distinct identities based on relics from Earth's past.

### The Factions

Robot evolution has created 14 distinct faction types, each with unique characteristics derived from their component materials and programming heritage:

**Ultra-Rare Legends (Elite Tier)**
- **UltimateMaster** 👑: The apex of robot evolution - only one exists. Commands respect across all wastelands
- **Wild** ⚡: Deranged by the solar flare of 2453 AD, unpredictable but powerful
- **Golden** ✨: Assembled from precious tech relics, radiating ancient energy
- **Ultimate** 🌟: Peak performance bots, nearly perfect engineering

**Super-Rare Powerhouses**
- **Blackhole** 🕳️: Mysterious bots with reality-warping abilities
- **Dead** 💀: Risen from the scrapyards, defying their shutdown protocols
- **Master** 🌙: Secretive society with connections to off-world Europa Base 7 colony

**Rare Specialists**
- **Bee** 🐝: Swarm-coordinated hive minds, relentless workers
- **Food** 🍔: Built from kitchen appliances and restaurant automation
- **Box** 📦: Heavy cargo haulers, immense strength
- **Murder** 🗡️: Former security bots, precision-focused

**Common Classes**
- **Game** 🎮: Constructed from video game consoles and entertainment tech
- **Animal** 🦁: Mimicking Earth's lost wildlife, diverse adaptations
- **Industrial** ⚙️: Workhorses of the wasteland, reliable and numerous

### Delta City

Controlled by the powerful and enigmatic **Silent Klan**, Delta City serves as the hub where sentient robots and mindless helper droids coexist. Giant trains traverse the sun-scorched wastelands, connecting the city to the garbage towers where lower-class bots scavenge ancient human technology to survive and thrive.
