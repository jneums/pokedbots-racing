## The World of PokedBots

### Year 2525 AD

Humans have long abandoned Earth, leaving only robots to inhabit the ruins. In the eastern wastelands, centered around the mysterious **Delta City**, various factions of robots have developed distinct identities based on relics from Earth's past.

### The Factions

- **Battle Bots** 🎮: Tough and built for hard work, constructed from old video game consoles and junk food toy parts salvaged from the giant rubbish heaps of former Antarctica

- **Entertainment Bots** 🎭: Flashy and charismatic, pieced together from ancient entertainment technology

- **Wild Bots** ⚡: Once normal robots, now deranged after the catastrophic solar flare of 2453 AD

- **God Class** 👑: Rulers of much of eastern Earth, possessing abilities far beyond standard bots

- **The Masters** 🌙: A secretive society with mysterious connections to the off-world Europa Base 7 colony

### Delta City

Controlled by the powerful and enigmatic **Silent Klan**, Delta City serves as the hub where sentient robots and mindless helper droids coexist. Giant trains traverse the sun-scorched wastelands, connecting the city to the garbage towers where lower-class bots scavenge ancient human technology to survive and thrive.
