# PokedBots Racing - Quick Start Guide

## THE BASICS

You own robot NFTs that race against each other for ICP prizes. Each bot has 4 stats that determine performance:

- **Speed** - Top speed on straightaways
- **Acceleration** - How fast you reach top speed
- **Power Core** - Energy efficiency (less battery drain) & hill climbing power
- **Stability** - Consistency & durability

## HOW RACING WORKS

### 1. Register Your Bot
Pay 0.1 ICP one-time fee to register your bot for a racing license.

### 2. Find a Race
Races are scheduled at specific times throughout the day. Each race has a class (Scrap/Junker/Raider/Elite/SilentKlan based on your bot's Rating), terrain type, and prize pool.

### 3. Pay Entry Fee
Entry fees range from 0.1-2.4 ICP depending on the event type and your bot's class. Up to 12 bots per race.

### 4. Race Happens Automatically
At the start of every race, the system simulates the race based on all bots' stats, condition, battery, terrain bonuses, and RNG.

### 5. Winners Get Paid
- **1st place:** 45% of prize pool
- **2nd place:** 28% of prize pool
- **3rd place:** 18% of prize pool
- **4th place:** 9% of prize pool
- Others: No prize

## KEY MECHANICS

### Battery (Energy)
Drains each race. Low battery = HUGE speed/accel penalties. At 50% battery you lose ~25% performance.
- **Recharge:** 0.1 ICP, restores 50-90 battery (RNG-based), 6hr cooldown
- **Overcharge bonus:** Recharging at low battery gives temporary boost for next race: +0.3% Speed/Accel per 1% overcharge (max +18% at 60% overcharge), but -0.2% Power Core/Stability per 1% overcharge (max -12%)

### Condition (Health)
Wears down each race. Low condition = reduced power core & stability stats (at 50% condition = -40% to those stats, at 0% condition = -90%).
- **Repair:** 0.05 ICP, restores 25 condition, 3hr cooldown

### Terrain Bonuses
Each bot prefers one terrain type (ScrapHeaps/WastelandSand/MetalRoads). Racing on your preferred terrain = +5% all stats.

### Factions
Each bot belongs to a faction with unique bonuses (Dead/Master/Blackhole/etc). These give stat boosts, terrain bonuses, or special abilities.

## BEGINNER STRATEGY

1. **Keep battery above 80%** for full performance
2. **Match your bot to races** on their preferred terrain
3. **Use scavenging** to earn free upgrade parts (no ICP cost!)
4. **Upgrade carefully** - costs increase as your bot gets stronger
5. **Manage maintenance costs** - recharge (0.1 ICP) + repair (0.05 ICP) = 0.15 ICP per cycle. To stay profitable, you need to win enough races to cover these costs. Consider using free maintenance zones (ChargingStation/RepairBay) when not racing urgently.
