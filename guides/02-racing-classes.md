# Racing Brackets (Classes) - Complete Guide

## HOW BRACKETS WORK

Your bot's **Rating** (average of max stats) determines which class of races you can enter. Rating is calculated from your bot's base stats + upgrade bonuses. This is separate from ELO, which is used for matchmaking within your class.

## 5 RACING CLASSES

- **Entry Fees:** 0.1 ICP (Daily Sprint), 0.4 ICP (Weekly League)

## KEY POINTS

- Winning = +ELO (for matchmaking within class), Losing = -ELO
- Rating determines class eligibility, ELO determines opponents within that class
- Prize pools scale with class difficulty and include platform bonuses
- Upgrade your stats to increase Rating and access higher classes

## ⚠️ BRACKET JUMPING WARNING

**Rating determines your race class!** Getting lucky with upgrades can accidentally bounce you into a higher bracket:

- **The Problem:** You're at Rating 19 (Scrap class) and upgrade a stat. You get a double point upgrade (+2 instead of +1) and your rating jumps to 20 → **instantly moved to Junker class** with higher entry fees and tougher competition!

- **Safe Approach:** If you're near a bracket boundary (e.g., 19.5 rating), avoid upgrading stats that would push you over. Wait until you have 2+ stats ready to upgrade at once, or focus on different stats to stay balanced.

- **Bracket Boundaries to Watch:**
  - Rating 19 → 20 (Scrap to Junker)
  - Rating 29 → 30 (Junker to Raider)
  - Rating 39 → 40 (Raider to Elite)
  - Rating 49 → 50 (Elite to SilentKlan)

- **Recommendation:** When within 2 points of a bracket jump, stop upgrading that stat until you're ready for the higher class. The double point lottery can catch you off guard!
