# Scavenging - Complete Guide

## What Is It?

Send your bots into the wasteland to gather upgrade parts. **No ICP cost** - only battery and condition consumption. You can register to race while scavenging - your bot will be pulled from the mission when the race starts (with penalties applied).

**⚠️ Minimum Requirement:** Your bot needs at least 10 battery to start any scavenging mission (including ChargingStation and RepairBay).

## 2 Mission Modes

### Continuous Mode (Default - No duration specified)
- Accumulates rewards every 15 minutes automatically
- Retrieve bot anytime from the UI
- Most flexible - run as long as you want
- **WARNING:** Bot dies if battery OR condition reaches 0 → **lose ALL pending rewards!**

### Timed Mode (Specify duration_minutes)
- Set specific duration: 15, 30, or 60 minutes
- Bot auto-returns when time expires with rewards
- Good for planning - set it and forget it
- **WARNING:** If bot dies before timer ends → **lose ALL pending rewards!**

## 5 Zones (Choose Your Strategy)

### Scavenging Zones (Earn Parts + World Buff Chance)

**ScrapHeaps - Safe & Balanced**
- 1.0x parts, 1.0x battery drain, 1.0x condition wear
- **40% Universal Parts**, 60% specialized (15% each type)
- ~10 parts/hour, ~20 battery/hour, ~8 condition/hour
- Best for: New bots, low-risk farming, safest option

**AbandonedSettlements - Moderate Risk/Reward**
- 1.6x parts, 2.0x battery drain, 2.0x condition wear
- **40% Universal Parts**, 60% specialized (15% each type)
- ~16 parts/hour, ~40 battery/hour, ~16 condition/hour
- Best for: More parts than ScrapHeaps, manageable costs

**DeadMachineFields - High Risk/Reward**
- 2.5x parts, 3.5x battery drain, 3.5x condition wear
- **40% Universal Parts**, 60% specialized (15% each type)
- ~25 parts/hour, ~70 battery/hour, ~28 condition/hour
- Best for: High stats bots, maximum parts (but highest costs)

### Maintenance Zones (Free Repairs - No Parts)

⚠️ **Minimum Requirement:** Your bot needs at least 10 battery to start any scavenging mission (including ChargingStation and RepairBay).

**RepairBay - Free Condition Restore**
- 0x parts, 2.0x battery drain, **RESTORES +12-18 condition/hour**
- Bypasses 12h repair cooldown and 0.05 ICP cost
- ~40 battery/hour, +12-18 condition/hour (with stat bonuses)
- Best for: Free repairs, damaged bots under 50% condition

**ChargingStation - Free Battery Restore**
- 0x parts, **RESTORES +1 battery per 15min** (4/hour)
- Bypasses 6h recharge cooldown and 0.1 ICP cost
- Takes 25 hours to fully charge from 0% (slow but FREE!)
- Best for: Patient players, saving ICP, low-priority bots

**💡 Pro Tip: Overcharge Strategy**
- Use **RepairBay** to spend battery while getting free condition repairs
- Overcharge formula: (100 - battery) × 0.4 × efficiency (capped at 60%)
- Lower battery at recharge = bigger overcharge potential (10% battery → ~36% overcharge avg)
- Efficiency varies by condition + RNG: 100% condition = 0.55-1.35× (highly random!)
- Overcharge bonus: +0.3% Speed/Accel per 1% overcharge (max +18% at 60%)
- Strategy: Drop battery low in RepairBay, then recharge for big one-time race boost!

## Part Types & Distribution

**5 Part Types:**
- **Universal Parts** - Use for ANY upgrade (most valuable!)
- **Speed Chips** - Speed upgrades only
- **Power Core Fragments** - Power Core upgrades only
- **Thruster Kits** - Acceleration upgrades only
- **Gyro Modules** - Stability upgrades only

**Part Exchange:**
- Convert specialized parts to other types at **25% cost**
- Example: 100 Speed Chips → 75 Thruster Kits
- Universal Parts are always better (no conversion loss!)

**Zone Strategy:**
- All zones have the same 40% Universal / 60% Specialized split
- Harder zones = MORE total parts (1.6x → 2.5x) but higher battery/condition costs
- Universal Parts let you upgrade any stat without conversion penalty

## Faction Bonuses (Specialization System)

Each faction excels at finding specific parts:

**Speed Specialists:** +30% Speed Chips
- Bee, Wild

**Power Specialists:** +30% Power Core Fragments
- Blackhole, Golden

**Acceleration Specialists:** +30% Thruster Kits
- Game, Animal

**Stability Specialists:** +30% Gyro Modules
- Industrial, Box

**Balanced Factions:** +15% Universal Parts
- Dead, Master, Murder, Food, UltimateMaster, Ultimate

**Strategy:** Specialize in your faction's parts, trade with others for parts you need!

## World Buffs (Bonus Stats)

**How It Works:**
- 2.0% base chance per 15-minute tick (~8% per hour)
- Up to 3.2% with 100 Acceleration stat (+60% boost)
- Grants 2-4 bonus stat points for your next race
- Expires in 48 hours if unused
- **Blackhole faction:** Gets +3 Speed/Accel BONUS on top of regular buff

**Important:**
- ONLY available in scavenging zones (ScrapHeaps, AbandonedSettlements, DeadMachineFields)
- NOT available in maintenance zones (RepairBay, ChargingStation)
- Earned during accumulation (not on completion to prevent spam)

## Stat Bonuses (Make Stats Matter!)

**Speed:** +10% parts yield at 100 Speed
**Power Core:** Up to -75% battery drain at 100 Power Core (exponential scaling)
**Stability:** Up to -75% condition loss at 100 Stability (exponential scaling)
**Acceleration:** +60% world buff chance at 100 Acceleration

## Pro Tips

- **Start with ScrapHeaps** - Safe way to learn mechanics with lowest battery/condition costs
- **High Power Core = efficiency** - Much less battery drain (exponential benefit)
- **High Stability = durability** - Survive dangerous zones longer
- **Monitor your bot!** - Check condition/battery regularly to avoid death
- **Use RepairBay** - Free alternative to 0.05 ICP repairs (slow but FREE)
- **Use ChargingStation** - Free alternative to 0.1 ICP recharge (25h for full charge, requires 10+ battery to start)
- **Faction matters** - Dead/Master/Murder = best for Universal Parts
- **Racing while scavenging** - Bot pulled when race starts, partial rewards + penalties applied

## Death Warning ⚠️

If your bot reaches **0 battery OR 0 condition** during scavenging:
- Mission ends immediately
- **ALL pending parts are LOST**
- Bot returns with 0 rewards

**Always leave a safety buffer!** Don't push your bot to the limit.
