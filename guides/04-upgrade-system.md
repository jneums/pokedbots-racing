# Upgrade Parts - Complete Guide

## WHAT ARE PARTS?

Currency for upgrading your bot's stats permanently. You gather them through scavenging missions (no ICP cost) or buy upgrades directly with ICP.

## 5 PART TYPES

- **Speed Chips** → Upgrade Speed (Velocity)
- **Power Core Fragments** → Upgrade Power Core
- **Thruster Kits** → Upgrade Acceleration (Thruster)
- **Gyro Modules** → Upgrade Stability (Gyro)
- **Universal Parts** → Can substitute for ANY type (most valuable!)

### Payment Options

**Pay with ICP (Dynamic Pricing):**

**Cost Formula:** `0.5 + (currentStat/40)²` × rating premium × synergy multiplier

**Example costs (per stat point):**
- Rating 20 bot, stat 20→21: ~0.43 ICP (43 parts)
- Rating 40 bot, stat 30→31: ~0.84 ICP (84 parts)
- Rating 60 bot, stat 40→41: ~1.78 ICP (178 parts)
- Rating 80 bot, stat 50→51: ~4.20 ICP (420 parts)

**Key Points:**
- Costs scale with BOTH current stat AND overall rating
- Higher individual stats get exponentially more expensive
- Spreading upgrades across multiple stats is cheaper than specializing

**Or Pay With Parts:**
- 100 parts = 1 ICP equivalent
- Use Speed Chips, Power Core Fragments, Thruster Kits, Gyro Modules
- Universal Parts work for any upgrade type

### Success Rates (RNG-Based)

Each stat tracked independently (Speed, Power Core, Acceleration, Stability):

- **Smooth curve:** 85% (first upgrade) → 15% (15th upgrade) → 1% (16+ upgrades)
- **Formula:** 85% - (upgradeCount × 5.6%), minimum 1%
- **Examples:**
  - 0 upgrades: 85.0%
  - 5 upgrades: 57.0%
  - 10 upgrades: 29.0%
  - 15 upgrades: 1.0%
  - 16+ upgrades: 1.0% (soft cap)

### Pity System

- +5% success per consecutive failure (max +25%)
- Resets on any success
- Persists across canister upgrades
- Can boost late-game 1% → 26% after 5 fails

### Double Point Lottery

- 15% → 2% chance (upgrades 0-15), then 0%
- Awards +2 stat points instead of +1
- Disabled completely after +15 upgrades per stat
- Creates exciting 'jackpot' moments

### 50% Refund on Failure

- **ICP:** 50% refunded automatically via prize distribution
- **Parts:** 50% returned directly to inventory
- Reduces financial risk for both payment types
- Refund matches payment method used

### Upgrade Duration

**Duration:** 12 hours (can race during upgrade)

## STRATEGY TIPS

- Early upgrades cheap & reliable (85% success, 0.43+ ICP)
- Gets expensive & risky after +10 upgrades
- Soft cap at +15 (15% success, then 1%)
- Use Universal Parts to avoid scavenging for specific types
- Pity system prevents long losing streaks
- 12 hours per upgrade (can race during it)
- Spreading stats is more cost-effective than specializing

**Example:** Rating 20 bot upgrading Speed from 20→21 costs 0.43 ICP, 85% success, 15% chance for +2.
