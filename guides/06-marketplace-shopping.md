# How to Shop for Bots on the Marketplace

## WHAT TO LOOK FOR

- **Rating 50+** = SilentKlan (rare on marketplace - likely need to upgrade from Elite)
- **Rating 40-49** = Elite starter, high price
- **Rating 30-39** = Raider starter, mid-tier price
- **Rating 20-29** = Junker starter, affordable
- **Rating 0-19** = Scrap starter, budget option
- **Terrain preference** = Match to common race types
- **Balanced stats** = More consistent than specialists
- **Faction bonuses** = Dead (scavenging), Blackhole (MetalRoads), Master (balanced)

## RATING GUIDE

**What is Rating?**
- Average of bot's 4 max stats (Speed, Power Core, Acceleration, Stability)
- Determines which race class you can enter
- Higher rating = access to bigger prize pools but tougher competition

**Beginner-Friendly Ratings:**
- **20-29 (Junker):** Best starting point - affordable, reasonable competition
- **30-39 (Raider):** Intermediate tier - good prize pools, manageable fees

**Advanced Ratings:**
- **40-49 (Elite):** Strong bots required - high entry fees, tough races
- **50+ (SilentKlan):** Top-tier only - highest prizes, best bots compete

## TERRAIN PREFERENCE

Each bot has a preferred terrain (derived from NFT background color):
- **ScrapHeaps**: +5% performance bonus on ScrapHeaps tracks
- **WastelandSand**: +5% performance bonus on WastelandSand tracks  
- **MetalRoads**: +5% performance bonus on MetalRoads tracks

**Strategy:** All terrains appear equally across race classes. Choose based on which terrain you want to specialize in or race most often.

## STAT DISTRIBUTION

**Balanced Bots (Recommended):**
- All 4 stats relatively equal
- More consistent performance across different race types
- Easier to manage and upgrade

**Specialist Bots (Advanced):**
- One or two stats maxed, others low

## BEGINNER SHOPPING CHECKLIST

1. **Set your budget** - Prices fluctuate with ICP market
2. **Choose Rating 20-29** (Junker) or 30-39 (Raider) for best starting experience
3. **Look for balanced stats** - Avoid heavy specialists
4. **Match terrain** to common race types
5. **Consider faction** - Dead/Master/Food for scavenging focus, Blackhole/Wild for racing
6. **Estimate upgrade potential** - Check upgrade counters to see growth room (see below)

## ESTIMATING UPGRADE POTENTIAL

**Why This Matters:**
A bot with fewer upgrades has more room to grow before hitting diminishing returns.

**How To Calculate Upgrades:**
Each stat shows: **Current Stat (Base Stat)**
- Current = Base + Successful Upgrades
- Example: `29 (22)` means 29 - 22 = **7 upgrades**

**Success Rate Guide:**
- Success rates: 85% (first upgrade) → 1% (at 15+ upgrades)
- Formula: 85% - (upgrades × 5.6%), minimum 1%

**What To Look For:**
- **0-5 upgrades per stat:** Excellent - high success rates (85-57%)
- **6-10 upgrades per stat:** Good - moderate success rates (51-29%)
- **11-15 upgrades per stat:** Fair - low success rates (23-1%)
- **15+ upgrades per stat:** Soft cap - 1% success rate (brutal)

**Example (Bot #1140 from screenshot):**
- Speed: 29 (22) = 7 upgrades → 46% success rate
- Power Core: 24 (18) = 6 upgrades → 51% success rate  
- Acceleration: 24 (22) = 2 upgrades → 74% success rate (great!)
- Stability: 16 (15) = 1 upgrade → 79% success rate (excellent!)

**Verdict:** Mixed potential - Speed/PWR harder to upgrade, ACC/STB still have great odds.

**Strategy:** Calculate upgrades for each stat (Current - Base). Favor bots with lower upgrade counts for easier/cheaper growth.

## ADVANCED TIPS

- **Low condition/battery bots** may be cheaper - factor in 0.15 ICP maintenance cost
- **Recently upgraded bots** have better stats but cost more
- **Ultra-rare factions** (UltimateMaster/Golden/Ultimate) have strongest base racing bonuses
- **Balanced factions** (Dead/Master/Food) excel at scavenging Universal Parts
