# Garage Management - Balancing Races & Scavenging

## THE CORE STRATEGY

Maximize income (race prizes) while gathering free parts (scavenging). Both can happen simultaneously!

## RACE-FIRST APPROACH (Recommended)

1. **Enter races when available** - Races happen multiple times daily, limited spots
2. **Fill downtime with scavenging** - Use continuous mode or timed missions
3. **Use RepairBay/ChargingStation** - Free maintenance zones to save ICP

## SCAVENGING WHILE RACING (Advanced)

You CAN register to race while scavenging. When race starts:
- Bot pulled from mission automatically
- Partial parts awarded (with 50% early withdrawal penalty)
- Condition damage scales with mission progress (minimum 50% of full penalty)

**Strategy:** Register for races opportunistically - penalties are manageable and prizes often exceed lost parts

## BATTERY/CONDITION MANAGEMENT

### Before Racing
- Keep battery 80%+ (recharge if below)
- Keep condition 90%+ (repair if needed)
- **Cost:** 0.1 ICP recharge + 0.05 ICP repair = 0.15 ICP maintenance

### After Racing
- Battery drains 10-20 per race
- Condition wears 3-7 per race
- Can usually do 3-4 races before needing maintenance

## OPTIMAL ROTATION (5 bots example)

### Bot 1-2: Racing focus
- Enter every available race in their class
- Scavenge 5h missions between races
- Maintain 80%+ battery/condition

### Bot 3-4: Scavenge focus
- Run continuous mode in DeadMachineFields or AbandonedSettlements
- Pull out for races when opportunities arise
- Use RepairBay/ChargingStation for free maintenance

### Bot 5: Flex/Upgrade
- Rotate through 12h upgrades
- Can still race while upgrading
- Scavenge when not upgrading

## PRO TIPS

- Dead faction bots = best scavengers (+30% Power Core Fragments bonus)
- High Power Core = less battery drain = more races between recharges (up to 30% reduction)
- Use free zones (ChargingStation, RepairBay) to minimize ICP costs
- Enter races early (spots fill up fast for good prizes)
- Continuous scavenging is most flexible - retrieve anytime

## COST OPTIMIZATION

### Expensive Approach (0.15 ICP per maintenance cycle)
- Pay 0.1 ICP recharge + 0.05 ICP repair every 3-4 races
- Fast recovery, can race immediately
- Best for active players racing frequently

### Free Approach (0 ICP, slow recovery)
- Use ChargingStation (25h for full charge) + RepairBay (5h for 60+ condition)
- No ICP cost, but much slower
- Best for casual players or low-priority bots

### Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
- Use ChargingStation/RepairBay when NOT racing urgently
- Pay ICP recharge/repair only when race window is closing
- Balances cost and flexibility
