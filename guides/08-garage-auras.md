## STRATEGY TIPS

### For New Players
- **Master faction** (2-4 bots) is best value - balanced stat bonuses at reasonable rarity
- **Food/Industrial** help reduce operating costs significantly
- Don't chase ultra-rares early - focus on building a cohesive 2-4 bot collection

### For Collectors
- **UltimateMaster** provides instant +5 rating boost from just 1 bot
- **Golden** (3 bots) gives massive +15% earnings boost - compounds over time
- **Dead** (4 bots) +30% parts generation makes self-upgrading easier

### For Competitive Players
- **Ultimate** (3 bots) +5 Speed/Accel makes your entire garage faster
- **Wild** (2 bots) +4 all stats is the most well-rounded ultra-rare bonus
- **Blackhole** (4 bots) +8 Power Core lets bots race more between recharges

### Mixed Collections
- Bonuses stack multiplicatively across different factions
- Example: 2 Master + 2 Dead = +2 all stats + 15% more parts
- Example: 1 UltimateMaster + 2 Food = +5 all stats + 15% faster recharges

## ECONOMIC IMPACT

### Stat Bonuses
**IMPORTANT:** Garage aura stat bonuses do NOT increase your bot's rating. Rating is calculated only from base stats + upgrades.

However, the effective stats in races ARE boosted, which means:
- **Competitive edge** - Your bots perform better in their current class without moving to harder brackets
- **Sweet spot advantage** - Stay in lower classes with boosted performance = easier wins
- **Hidden power** - Bots appear weaker on paper but race stronger
- **No upgrade pressure** - Less need to upgrade stats, save ICP for other uses

**Example:** A rating 30 bot with +5 from UltimateMaster aura still enters Raider races (30-39), but races with effective 35 stats against true 30-35 opponents.

### Cost Bonuses
- **Game** (6 bots): Save 20% on all upgrades (0.5 ICP → 0.4 ICP base)
- **Industrial** (6 bots): Save 60% on repairs (0.05 ICP → 0.02 ICP)
- **Food** (6 bots): Recharge 45% faster (race 2-3 more times per day)

### Yield Bonuses
- **Golden** (3 bots): +15% race earnings compounds rapidly
- **Dead** (4 bots): +30% parts generation = faster self-upgrading
- **Ultimate** (3 bots): -30% scavenging costs = longer missions, more parts

## HOW TO BUILD YOUR COLLECTION

1. **Choose your focus:** Racing performance (stat bonuses) vs Economic efficiency (cost/yield bonuses)
2. **Start with 2-4 bots** of one faction to activate first tier bonuses
3. **Scale gradually** - rare factions need 6 bots for max effect
4. **Mix strategically** - combine stat factions with cost factions for balanced benefits
5. **Consider resale** - collection bonuses make your entire garage more valuable

## IMPORTANT NOTES

- Bonuses apply immediately when you acquire the required bot count
- Bonuses disappear if you sell/transfer bots and drop below the threshold
- All bots in your garage benefit, regardless of their own faction
- Marketplace bots do NOT count toward your bonuses (must be in your garage)
- Bonuses persist across races - they're always active
