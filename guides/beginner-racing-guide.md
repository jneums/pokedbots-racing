## Your First Purchase

   - Ultra Budget: 16-30 ICP → Start with Token #5100 (16 ICP) or #4525 (20 ICP super-rare)
   - Enthusiast: 40-50 ICP → **Get Token #4343** (super-rare Blackhole, best value)

2. **Understand What You're Getting**
   - Check the stats - are they balanced or specialized?
   - Look at the faction bonuses (super-rare > rare > common)
   - Consider the terrain preference
   - View the thumbnail image

3. **Make the Purchase**
   - Use the marketplace tool: `purchase_pokedbot`
   - Confirm you have enough ICP in your account
   - Bot will be transferred to your garage

4. **Initialize Your Bot**
   - After purchase, initialize it for racing (free, one-time)
   - This reveals full stats and registers your racing license
   - You can't race until you initialize!

---

## Quick Start Race Strategy

### For Your First 5 Races

1. **Start with Practice Races** (Scavenger class)
   - Entry fee: 0.05-0.5 ICP (Scavenger class)
   - Short distances (3-8km)
   - Lower stakes, good for learning

2. **Match Your Bot to the Race**
   - **MetalRoads terrain:** Use any bot with good speed
   - **WastelandSand:** Use high stability bot (Dead, Animal factions)
   - **ShortSprint (<5km):** Use bot with high speed + acceleration
   - **MediumHaul (5-15km):** Use balanced stats bot
   - **LongHaul (>15km):** Use high power + stability bot

3. **Learn from Each Race**
   - Watch how your stats perform
   - Note which terrain you do well on
   - Compare against other bots' stats

4. **Upgrade Strategically**
   - Don't upgrade immediately - learn your bot first
   - Focus on your bot's weakest stat or double down on strengths
   - Upgrades cost ICP/parts and take 12 hours

---

## Common Beginner Mistakes

### ❌ Don't Do This:
1. **Buying the cheapest bot possible**
   - Bots under 35 rating will lose most races
   - Spend at least 16-20 ICP for decent stats

2. **Ignoring faction bonuses**
   - Super-rare factions (Blackhole, Dead, Master) have huge bonuses
   - Rare factions (Bee, Food, Box, Murder) have good bonuses
   - Common factions (Game, Animal, Industrial) are affordable

3. **Racing without checking terrain**
   - High stability bots dominate WastelandSand
   - High speed bots excel on MetalRoads
   - Always match your bot's strengths to the race

4. **Upgrading before racing**
   - Learn how your bot performs first
   - You might upgrade the wrong stat

5. **Entering races you can't win**
   - Check the competition's stats before entering
   - Don't enter Elite/SilentKlan races with a 35-rated bot

### ✅ Do This Instead:
1. **Buy a super-rare faction bot first** (like Blackhole #4343 or Master #4525)
2. **Start with Scavenger class races** (easiest tier)
3. **Match terrain to your bot's strengths**
4. **Race 5-10 times before upgrading**
5. **Learn the community** (watch other races, ask questions)

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>💰 How much ICP do I need to start?</strong></summary>

Minimum 16 ICP for a bot, plus ~1-2 ICP for your first few race entries. **20-30 ICP is recommended** for a comfortable start with a super-rare faction bot and room for races and repairs.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>❌ Can I lose ICP racing?</strong></summary>

Yes - entry fees are not refunded if you lose. Start with cheap Scavenger Daily races (0.05 ICP entry) to learn the mechanics before risking more ICP on higher-stakes races or upgrading to higher classes.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔋 What happens if my bot's battery runs out?</strong></summary>

You need to recharge (10 ICP, 6 hour cooldown) to restore battery and condition. Keep an eye on your battery level - it drains by 10 per race, and you can't enter races with less than 50 battery.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔧 Should I repair or recharge my bot?</strong></summary>

- **Recharge (10 ICP):** Restores +20 condition AND +10 battery. Best when battery is low.
- **Repair (5 ICP):** Restores +10 condition only. Use when battery is fine but condition is dropping.

If you can afford it, recharging is usually the better value.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>💸 Can I sell my bot later?</strong></summary>

Yes! List it on the marketplace anytime. Bots with good race records, high ratings, and rare factions sell for more. Your bot's career stats are permanent, so building a winning record increases its value.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🤖 Which faction is best for beginners?</strong></summary>

**Super-Rare Factions (Master, Dead, Blackhole)** - Best bonuses and prestige at reasonable prices. Once you understand the game:
- **Game/Animal/Industrial** (Common tier) for budget learning
- **Bee/Food/Box/Murder** (Rare tier) for specialized strategies
- **Wild/Golden/Ultimate** (Ultra-rare tier) when you're ready for elite collecting
