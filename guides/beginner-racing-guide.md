## Quick Start Race Strategy

### For Your First 5 Races

1. **Start with Practice Races** (Scavenger class)
   - Entry fee: ~0.05-0.1 ICP
   - Short distances (3-8km)
   - Lower stakes, good for learning

2. **Match Your Bot to the Race**
   - **MetalRoads terrain:** Use BattleBot or any bot with good speed
   - **WastelandSand:** Use WildBot or high stability bot
   - **ShortSprint (<5km):** Use bot with high acceleration + speed
   - **MediumHaul (5-15km):** Use balanced stats bot
   - **LongHaul (>15km):** Use high power + stability bot

3. **Learn from Each Race**
   - Watch how your stats perform
   - Note which terrain you do well on
   - Compare against other bots' stats

4. **Upgrade Strategically**
   - Don't upgrade immediately - learn your bot first
   - Focus on your bot's weakest stat
   - Upgrades cost 20 ICP and take 12 hours

---

## Common Beginner Mistakes

### ❌ Don't Do This:
1. **Buying the cheapest bot possible**
   - Bots under 50 rating will lose most races
   - Spend at least 6-10 ICP for decent stats

2. **Ignoring faction bonuses**
   - BattleBot's +8 Power is huge for endurance
   - WildBot's +9 Stability makes rough terrain easy
   - Choose faction based on your race type

3. **Racing without checking terrain**
   - A 70 speed bot can lose to a 60 speed bot on wrong terrain
   - Always match your bot's strengths to the race

4. **Upgrading before racing**
   - Learn how your bot performs first
   - You might upgrade the wrong stat

5. **Entering races you can't win**
   - Check the competition's stats before entering
   - Don't enter Elite/SilentKlan races with a 55-rated bot

### ✅ Do This Instead:
1. **Buy a balanced bot first** (like Token #236 or #382)
2. **Start with Scavenger class races** (easiest tier)
3. **Match terrain to your bot's strengths**
4. **Race 5-10 times before upgrading**
5. **Learn the community** (watch other races, ask questions)

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>💰 How much ICP do I need to start?</strong></summary>

Minimum 6 ICP for a bot, plus ~1 ICP for your first few race entries. **10-15 ICP is recommended** for a comfortable start with room for a few races and potential repairs.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>❌ Can I lose ICP racing?</strong></summary>

Yes - entry fees are not refunded if you lose. Start with cheap Scavenger races (0.05-0.1 ICP entry) to learn the mechanics before risking more ICP on higher-stakes races.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔋 What happens if my bot's battery runs out?</strong></summary>

You need to recharge (10 ICP, 6 hour cooldown) to restore battery and condition. Keep an eye on your battery level - it drains by 10 per race, and you can't enter races with less than 50 battery.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔧 Should I repair or recharge my bot?</strong></summary>

- **Recharge (10 ICP):** Restores +20 condition AND +10 battery. Best when battery is low.
- **Repair (5 ICP):** Restores +10 condition only. Use when battery is fine but condition is dropping.

If you can afford it, recharging is usually the better value.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>💸 Can I sell my bot later?</strong></summary>

Yes! List it on the marketplace anytime. Bots with good race records, high ratings, and rare factions sell for more. Your bot's career stats are permanent, so building a winning record increases its value.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🤖 Which faction is best for beginners?</strong></summary>

**BattleBot** - Reliable, common, and good for learning the basics. Once you understand the game:
- **EntertainmentBot** for speed-focused strategies
- **WildBot** for rough terrain and stability
- **GodClass/Master** when you're ready to invest in elite performance

</details>
