# PokedBots Racing - Complete Beginner's Guide

## THE BASICS

You own robot NFTs that race against each other for ICP prizes. Each bot has 4 stats that determine performance:

- **Speed** - Top speed on straightaways
- **Acceleration** - How fast you reach top speed
- **Power Core** - Energy efficiency (less battery drain)
- **Stability** - Consistency & durability

## HOW RACING WORKS

### 1. Find a Race
Races are scheduled at specific times (every 6 hours). Each race has a class (Junker/Raider/Elite/SilentKlan based on your bot's ELO rating), terrain type, and prize pool.

### 2. Pay Entry Fee
Small ICP fee to enter (0.1-0.2 ICP typically). Up to 12 bots per race.

### 3. Race Happens Automatically
At race time, the system simulates the race based on all bots' stats, condition, battery, terrain bonuses, and RNG.

### 4. Winners Get Paid
Top finishers split the prize pool (1st gets most, 2nd/3rd get smaller cuts).

## KEY MECHANICS

### Battery (Energy)
Drains each race. Low battery = HUGE speed/accel penalties. At 50% battery you lose ~25% performance.
- **Recharge:** 0.1 ICP, restores 75 battery, 6hr cooldown

### Condition (Health)
Wears down each race. Low condition = inconsistent performance (wild RNG swings).
- **Repair:** 0.05 ICP, restores 25 condition, 3hr cooldown

### Terrain Bonuses
Each bot prefers one terrain type (ScrapHeaps/WastelandSand/MetalRoads). Racing on your preferred terrain = +5% all stats.

### Factions
Each bot belongs to a faction with unique bonuses (Dead/Master/Blackhole/etc). These give stat boosts, terrain bonuses, or special abilities.

## STRATEGY TIPS

- Keep battery above 80% for full performance
- Match your bot to races on their preferred terrain
- Higher-rated bots enter higher-class races with bigger prizes
- You can race while upgrading or scavenging (multitask!)

## MAINTENANCE

- **Scavenging** - Send bots on 5h/11h/23h missions to gather upgrade parts (no ICP cost, just battery)
- **Upgrading** - Spend parts to permanently increase stats (12hr sessions)
- Both can happen while racing!

# Racing Brackets (Classes) - Complete Guide

## HOW BRACKETS WORK

Your bot's ELO rating determines which class of races you can enter. ELO goes up when you win, down when you lose. Think of it like a skill-based matchmaking system.

## 4 RACING CLASSES

### JUNKER CLASS (Beginner)

- **ELO Range:** 1200-1499
- **Entry Point:** New bots start at 1200-1400 ELO (based on rating quality)
- **Exit Point:** Win enough to reach 1500 ELO → promoted to Raider
- **Prize Pools:** Smallest (0.50-0.65 ICP typical)
- **Competition:** Weakest bots, easiest wins

### RAIDER CLASS (Intermediate)

- **ELO Range:** 1500-1699
- **Entry Point:** Promoted from Junker at 1500 ELO, OR new bots with 20-60 rating start here
- **Exit Point:** Win to 1700 ELO → Elite | Lose below 1500 → demoted to Junker
- **Prize Pools:** Medium (0.80-1.10 ICP typical)
- **Competition:** Mid-tier bots

### ELITE CLASS (Advanced)

- **ELO Range:** 1700-1899
- **Entry Point:** Promoted from Raider at 1700 ELO, OR new bots with 60+ rating start at 1800 ELO
- **Exit Point:** Win to 1900 ELO → SilentKlan | Lose below 1700 → demoted to Raider
- **Prize Pools:** Large (0.75-1.40 ICP typical)
- **Competition:** Strong bots, tougher field

### SILENTKLAN CLASS (Elite/Pro)

- **ELO Range:** 1900+
- **Entry Point:** Promoted from Elite at 1900 ELO
- **Exit Point:** Lose below 1900 → demoted to Elite
- **Prize Pools:** Largest (varies, top-tier competition)
- **Competition:** Best bots only

## KEY POINTS

- You can ONLY enter races in your current class
- Winning = +ELO, Losing = -ELO (amount varies by opponent strength)
- Better bots start in higher classes (based on initial rating)
- Prize pools scale with class difficulty
- Can't "sandbag" in lower classes - ELO forces you up

# Scavenging - Beginner's Guide

## What Is It?

Send your bots into the wasteland to gather upgrade parts. No ICP cost - just battery and condition wear. You can scavenge while racing!

## 3 Mission Lengths

- **ShortExpedition (5h):** 15-35 parts, costs 10 battery
- **DeepSalvage (11h):** 40-80 parts, costs 20 battery
- **WastelandExpedition (23h):** 100-200 parts, costs 40 battery

## 3 Danger Zones (you choose)

- **ScrapHeaps:** Safe (normal rewards, 40% universal parts)
- **AbandonedSettlements:** Moderate risk (1.4x parts, 1.15x condition damage, 25% universal)
- **DeadMachineFields:** High danger (2x parts, 1.3x condition damage, only 10% universal)

## Part Types

- Speed Chips, Power Core Fragments, Thruster Kits, Gyro Modules
- **Universal Parts** - Can substitute for any type when upgrading

## Why Risk Matters

Higher danger zones give MORE specialized parts but LESS universal parts. If you need specific parts for upgrades, go dangerous. If you want flexibility, stay safe.

## World Buffs (15% chance)

Random bonus stats for your next race! Longer missions = bigger buffs. Expires in 48h if unused.

## Pro Tips

- High Power Core stat = less battery drain
- High Stability = less condition damage in dangerous zones
- Dead faction bots get 1.4x parts in DeadMachineFields + take 50% less condition damage (perfect scavengers!)
- You can race while scavenging, but if your race starts before mission ends, you'll take penalties

# Upgrade Parts - Complete Guide

## WHAT ARE PARTS?

Currency for upgrading your bot's stats permanently. You gather them through scavenging missions (no ICP cost) or buy upgrades directly with ICP.

## 5 PART TYPES

- **Speed Chips** → Upgrade Speed (Velocity)
- **Power Core Fragments** → Upgrade Power Core
- **Thruster Kits** → Upgrade Acceleration (Thruster)
- **Gyro Modules** → Upgrade Stability (Gyro)
- **Universal Parts** → Can substitute for ANY type (most valuable!)

## UPGRADE COSTS (Escalating)

- 1st upgrade: 100 parts
- 2nd upgrade: 200 parts
- 3rd upgrade: 300 parts
- 4th upgrade: 900 parts
- 5th upgrade: 2,700 parts
- 6th upgrade: 8,100 parts

*Note: These costs may be adjusted for balance*

## STAT GAINS (RNG-based)

- **1st upgrade:** +1 to +3 points (guaranteed at least +1)
- **2nd-3rd:** +1 to +2 points (guaranteed at least +1)
- **4th+:** Usually +1 point (can be 0 if unlucky)

Faction bonuses can double your gains (20-35% chance depending on rarity).

## DIFFICULTY SCALING

Higher stats = harder to upgrade. At 60+ you get reduced gains, at 90+ only 20% effectiveness.

## STRATEGY

- Use Universal Parts for expensive upgrades (900+)
- Scavenge in dangerous zones for 2x specialized parts
- Scavenge in safe zones for more Universal Parts (40% vs 10%)
- Upgrade takes 12 hours but you can race during it!

**Example:** Upgrading a bot's Speed (1st upgrade) costs 100 Speed Chips or 100 Universal Parts, takes 12h, gives +1 to +3 Speed.

# Garage Management - Balancing Races & Scavenging

## THE CORE STRATEGY

Maximize income (race prizes) while gathering free parts (scavenging). Both can happen simultaneously!

## RACE-FIRST APPROACH (Recommended)

1. **Enter races when available** - Races happen every 6 hours, limited spots
2. **Fill downtime with scavenging** - Between races, send bots on missions
3. **Time scavenging to finish BEFORE races** - Avoid withdrawal penalties

## TIMING EXAMPLES

### Scenario 1: Race in 8 hours
Start 5h scavenge now → completes 3h before race → recharge/repair if needed → race fresh

### Scenario 2: Race in 14 hours
Start 11h scavenge now → completes 3h before race → prep for race

### Scenario 3: No races scheduled
Start 23h scavenge → maximize parts gathering

## SCAVENGING WHILE RACING (Advanced)

You CAN race while scavenging, BUT if race starts before mission ends:
- Partial parts awarded (with 50% penalty)
- Condition damage scales with progress
- NOT profitable for early withdrawals

**Only do this if:** Race prize is worth more than lost parts + condition damage

## BATTERY/CONDITION MANAGEMENT

### Before Racing
- Keep battery 80%+ (recharge if below)
- Keep condition 90%+ (repair if needed)
- **Cost:** 0.1 ICP recharge + 0.05 ICP repair = 0.15 ICP maintenance

### After Racing
- Battery drains 10-20 per race
- Condition wears 3-7 per race
- Can usually do 3-4 races before needing maintenance

## OPTIMAL ROTATION (5 bots example)

### Bot 1-2: Racing focus
- Enter every available race in their class
- Scavenge 5h missions between races
- Maintain 80%+ battery/condition

### Bot 3-4: Scavenge focus
- Run 11h or 23h missions constantly
- Enter races only when convenient
- Lower maintenance costs

### Bot 5: Flex/Upgrade
- Rotate through 12h upgrades
- Can still race while upgrading
- Scavenge when not upgrading

## PRO TIPS

- Dead faction bots = best scavengers (1.4x parts in DeadMachineFields)
- High Power Core = less battery drain = more races between recharges
- Enter races early (12 spots fill up fast for good prizes)
- Track cooldowns - recharge/repair immediately when available if racing soon
