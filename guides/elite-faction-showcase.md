## Racing Strategy by Faction

### GodClass Strategy:
- **Versatility is key** - Your +15 to all stats means you can adapt to any race type
- **Don't specialize** - Let other factions focus on one stat, you're good at everything
- **Play the field** - Enter diverse race types to capitalize on balanced strength
- **Prestige matters** - Flaunt that 2.7% rarity

### Master Strategy:
- **Leverage speed** - Your +12 speed bonus makes you the fastest in straightaways
- **Endurance races** - Your +12 power bonus dominates long-haul events
- **Avoid pure stability races** - Only +8 stability, not your strength
- **MetalRoads dominance** - Speed-focused tracks are your home
