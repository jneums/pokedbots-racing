## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Buying Without Research
**Mistake:** Buying first bot you see  
**Solution:** Compare 10-20 bots, calculate value scores

**Mistake:** Racing with <70 condition or <50 battery  
**Solution:** Recharge before critical thresholds

### 4. Random Upgrades
**Mistake:** Upgrading without strategy  
**Solution:** Plan upgrades around terrain specialization

### 5. Wrong Race Class
**Mistake:** Entering Elite races with 55-rated bot  
**Solution:** Progress through classes, build win record

### 6. Ignoring Terrain

**Solution:** Match bot strengths to race conditions

### 7. Panic Selling
**Mistake:** Selling after a few losses  
**Solution:** Give bots 20+ races to prove themselves

### 8. Upgrade During Events
