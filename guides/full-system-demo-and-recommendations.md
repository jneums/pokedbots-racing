## 🔧 Upgrade Strategy Matrix

### Understanding the Upgrade System

PokedBots Racing uses a **progressive cost, scrap-based upgrade system** with three paths to upgrading:

**Path 1: Direct ICP Purchase** (Current)
- 20 ICP → 3 specific parts (e.g., Speed Chips for Velocity upgrades)
- Instant materials, no waiting
- Simple and predictable

**Path 2: Scrap NFTs** (Planned)
- Purchase NFTs from any EXT collection marketplace
- Scrap them for parts based on rarity and value
- Example: 100 ICP ICPunk → ~15 Universal Parts (60 ICP equivalent)
- Potential 30-50% savings for skilled scrappers

**Path 3: Hybrid** (Planned)
- Combine scrap parts + ICP for discounts
- Example: 2 parts + 10 ICP = upgrade (50% discount)

### Progressive Cost Curve

Each successive upgrade to the **same stat** costs more parts:

```
Upgrade #1:  3 parts → +1-3 to stat (~20 ICP)
Upgrade #2:  5 parts → +1-2 to stat (~35 ICP)
Upgrade #3:  8 parts → +1-2 to stat (~55 ICP)
Upgrade #4: 12 parts → +0-1 to stat (~80 ICP)
Upgrade #5: 18 parts → +0-1 to stat (~120 ICP)
Upgrade #6: 25 parts → +0-1 to stat (~170 ICP)
```

**Why This Matters:**
- First upgrade is affordable (20 ICP)
- Early upgrades give best returns (+1-3 stat points)
- Later upgrades have diminishing returns (+0-1 stat points)
- Creates natural stat caps around 70-75
- Preserves value of naturally high-stat bots

### When to Upgrade

**After 3 Races:**
- Identify your bot's weakest stat
- First upgrade to any stat: 3 parts (~20 ICP)
- Best bang for buck: +1-3 stat points

**After 10 Races:**
- Second upgrade to same stat: 5 parts (~35 ICP)
- OR first upgrade to different stat: 3 parts (~20 ICP)
- Consider terrain specialization

**After 20 Races:**
- Third upgrade to primary stat: 8 parts (~55 ICP)
- OR spread upgrades across multiple stats
- Focus on your preferred race type

**After 50 Races:**
- Fourth+ upgrades get expensive (12+ parts)
- Consider if 80-120 ICP for +0-1 is worth it
- May be better to buy a second bot or diversify stats

---

### Upgrade Priority by Bot Type

**Balanced Bot (all stats 55-65):**
1. **First upgrade (3 parts)**: Speed (biggest impact on race times)
2. **Second upgrade (3 parts)**: Acceleration (different stat = still cheap!)
3. **Third upgrade (3 parts)**: Power OR Stability
4. **Fourth upgrade (5 parts)**: Second Speed upgrade (now more expensive)
- Strategy: Spread early upgrades across stats to keep costs low

**Speed Specialist (Speed 70+):**
1. **First (3 parts)**: Acceleration (complement strength, cheap)
2. **Second (3 parts)**: Stability (cover weakness, still cheap)
3. **Third (5 parts)**: Second Speed upgrade (already at 70, so 2nd upgrade)
4. **Fourth (3 parts)**: Power (new stat, back to cheap cost)
- Strategy: Avoid pushing already-high stats early (expensive!)

**Endurance Specialist (Power 70+):**
1. **First (3 parts)**: Stability (complement strength)
2. **Second (3 parts)**: Speed (improve race times)
3. **Third (5 parts)**: Second Power upgrade (maximize strength)
4. **Fourth (3 parts)**: Acceleration (round out build)
- Strategy: Build complementary stats first, then double down

**Low-Rated Bot (50-55):**
1. **First (3 parts)**: Weakest stat (bring to 53-55)
2. **Second (3 parts)**: Second weakest stat (balance)
3. **Third (3 parts)**: Third stat (all upgrades still cheap!)
4. **Fourth (5-8 parts)**: Decision time - worth it or buy better bot?
- Strategy: Low-stat bots benefit most from spreading cheap upgrades

## 🔩 Upgrade Economics & Strategy

### Realistic Stat Progression

Due to progressive costs and diminishing returns, here's what to expect:

```
Starting stat: 50
After 1 upgrade (20 ICP):  53-55 (+3-5 total)
After 2 upgrades (55 ICP): 55-58 (+5-8 total)
After 3 upgrades (110 ICP): 58-62 (+8-12 total)
After 4 upgrades (190 ICP): 60-65 (+10-15 total)
After 5 upgrades (310 ICP): 62-67 (+12-17 total)
After 6 upgrades (480 ICP): 64-70 (+14-20 total)

Practical max: 70-75 (cost becomes prohibitive)
Theoretical max: 100 (would cost thousands of ICP)
```

### Smart Upgrade Paths

**Budget Path (60-100 ICP total):**
- 3 first upgrades to different stats (3 parts each = 60 ICP)
- Example: Speed +3, Acceleration +2, Stability +2
- Result: Well-rounded bot, all stats improved, affordable
- **Best value per ICP spent**

**Competitive Path (100-250 ICP total):**
- 2 first upgrades (3 parts each = 40 ICP)
- 2 second upgrades (5 parts each = 70 ICP)
- 1 third upgrade (8 parts = 55 ICP)
- Result: Specialized bot with 2-3 strong stats
- **Good balance of power and cost**

**Elite Path (250-500 ICP total):**
- 4 first upgrades (12 parts = 80 ICP)
- 3 second upgrades (15 parts = 105 ICP)
- 2 third upgrades (16 parts = 110 ICP)
- 1 fourth upgrade (12 parts = 80 ICP)
- Result: Highly optimized specialist, multiple stats 65+
- **Competitive in top-tier races**

**Whale Path (500+ ICP):**
- Push multiple stats to 70+
- Fourth, fifth, sixth upgrades (12-25 parts each)
- Diminishing returns (+0-1 per upgrade)
- Only for collectors or SilentKlan racers
- **More cost-effective to buy multiple specialized bots**

### Faction Upgrade Advantages

**GodClass (+15 all stats):**
- Start with effectively 65-85 stats (50-70 base + 15 bonus)
- Difficulty modifiers reduced by 20%
- Higher chance of +2-3 on later upgrades
- **Best upgrade value - compound bonuses**

**WildBot (+9 STB, +6 ACC):**
- ±10% variance on stat gains
- Can get lucky with +4-5 on some upgrades
- Can also get unlucky with +0-1
- **Gambling playstyle**

**Others (BattleBot, Entertainment, Master):**
- Standard upgrade progression
- Predictable 1-3 gains on early upgrades
- **Consistent and reliable**

### When NOT to Upgrade

❌ **Don't upgrade if:**
- Stat already at 70+ (costs 80-170 ICP for +0-1)
- You have <50 ICP total budget (buy better bot instead)
- Bot condition <50 or battery <30 (upgrade will fail)
- You're about to sell the bot (buyers factor in base stats more)
- Already have 4+ upgrades to one stat (diminishing returns)

✅ **DO upgrade if:**
- First upgrade to any stat (3 parts, great value)
- Stat is below 60 (lots of room to grow)
- You race frequently (ROI through prizes)
- You have scrap parts already (free/discounted)
- Specializing for specific terrain/distance

---

## 💰 Maintenance Budget Planning

### Per-Race Operating Costs

**Battery Depletion:**
- Each race: -10 battery
- Can race 5 times before recharge needed
- Recharge: 0.1 ICP (+10 battery, +20 condition)

**Condition Degradation:**
- Varies by race difficulty and results
- Crashes/poor performance = more degradation
- Repair: 0.05 ICP (+10 condition only)
- Recharge: 0.1 ICP (+20 condition, +10 battery)

**Recommended Maintenance Schedule:**
- After 5 races: Recharge (0.1 ICP)
- If condition <70 between recharges: Repair (0.05 ICP)
- Budget: ~0.02 ICP per race for maintenance

**Net After Entry Fees: 8.44 - 2 = 6.44 ICP profit from racing**

**Exit Strategy:**
- Sell upgraded bot: 12-18 ICP (6 ICP base + 6-12 ICP upgrade premium)

**Total Return: 6.44 racing + 12-18 bot sale = 18.44-24.44 ICP**
**Net: +0.04 to +6.04 ICP**
**ROI: +0.2% to +33% profit!**

**Reality Check:** Budget Scavenger racers can now BREAK EVEN or turn small profit! The 10 ICP upgrade cost makes this tier actually viable. With 30% win rate, you profit 0-6 ICP while learning the game. This is the perfect onboarding experience.

### Scenario 2: Competitive Racer (Raider Class, 30 ICP bot)
**Investment:**
- Bot: 30 ICP
- 30 Raider Daily races at 0.1 ICP: 3 ICP
- 10 Raider Weekly races at 0.4 ICP: 4 ICP
- Maintenance (8 recharges): 0.8 ICP
- 3 upgrades (3×10 ICP first upgrades): 30 ICP
- **Total: 67.8 ICP**

**Realistic Performance (40% win rate in Raider class):**
**Daily Sprints (30 races, 12 wins):**
- 12 wins: 12 × 0.60 = **7.20 ICP**
- 8 seconds: 8 × 0.30 = **2.40 ICP**
- 6 thirds: 6 × 0.18 = **1.08 ICP**
- Subtotal: **10.68 ICP**

- 4 wins: 4 × 2.39 = **9.56 ICP**
- 3 seconds: 3 × 1.20 = **3.60 ICP**
- 2 thirds: 2 × 0.72 = **1.44 ICP**
- Subtotal: **14.60 ICP**

**Total Prizes: 25.28 ICP**
**Net After Entry Fees: 25.28 - 7 = 18.28 ICP profit from racing!**

**Exit Strategy:**
- Sell upgraded bot: 60-90 ICP (30 base + 30-60 premium + win record)

**Total Return: 18.28 racing + 60-90 bot = 78.28-108.28 ICP**
**Net: +10.48 to +40.48 ICP**
**ROI: +15% to +60% profit!**

**Reality Check:** Raider class is now HIGHLY PROFITABLE! With just 40% win rate, you make 10-40 ICP profit. The combination of class scaling, platform bonuses, and affordable upgrades creates a sustainable income stream. Weekly Leagues pay 2.39 ICP per win - this is the sweet spot for competitive players.

### Scenario 3: Elite Racer (Elite/SilentKlan, 99 ICP GodClass)
**Investment:**
- Bot: 99 ICP
- 20 Elite Daily races at 0.25 ICP: 5 ICP
- 10 Elite Weekly races at 1.0 ICP: 10 ICP
- 5 SilentKlan Weekly races at 2.0 ICP: 10 ICP
- 2 Monthly Cups at 0.5/5.0 ICP: 5.5 ICP
- Maintenance (12 recharges): 1.2 ICP
- 5 upgrades (10+17+27+40+60 ICP): 154 ICP
- **Total: 284.7 ICP**

**Realistic Performance (50% win rate in Elite, 40% in SilentKlan):**

**Elite Daily Sprints (20 races, 10 wins, NO BONUS):**
- 10 wins: 10 × 0.90 = **9.00 ICP**
- 5 seconds: 5 × 0.45 = **2.25 ICP**
- 3 thirds: 3 × 0.27 = **0.81 ICP**
- Subtotal: **12.06 ICP**

**Elite Weekly Leagues (10 races, 5 wins, NO BONUS):**
- 5 wins: 5 × 3.61 = **18.05 ICP**
- 3 seconds: 3 × 1.81 = **5.43 ICP**
- 2 thirds: 2 × 1.08 = **2.16 ICP**
- Subtotal: **25.64 ICP**

**SilentKlan Weekly Leagues (5 races, 2 wins, NO BONUS):**
- 2 wins: 2 × 7.22 = **14.44 ICP**
- 2 seconds: 2 × 3.61 = **7.22 ICP**
- 1 third: 1 × 2.17 = **2.17 ICP**
- Subtotal: **23.83 ICP**

**Monthly Cups (2 events with bonuses, mixed placement):**
- Elite Cup (16 racers, 0.5 entry + 5 bonus): 1st place = **6.65 ICP**
- SilentKlan Cup (8 racers, 5.0 entry + 5 bonus): 2nd place = **11.40 ICP**
- Subtotal: **18.05 ICP**

**Total Prizes: 79.58 ICP**
**Net After Entry Fees: 79.58 - 30.5 = 49.08 ICP profit from racing!**

**Exit Strategy:**
- Sell heavily upgraded GodClass: 200-350 ICP (99 base + 100-250 premium + elite record)

**Total Return: 49.08 racing + 200-350 bot = 249.08-399.08 ICP**
**Net: -35.62 to +114.38 ICP**
**ROI: -13% to +40%**

**Reality Check:** Elite/SilentKlan racers face higher entry fees BUT get massive prize pools from the class multipliers. No platform bonuses needed - the 3.6x-7.2 ICP first place prizes are self-sustaining. With 40-50% win rates, elite racers earn **serious income** from racing alone (49 ICP profit in this scenario). Lower upgrade costs mean you reach profitability faster and can invest more in racing.

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Buying Without Research
**Mistake:** Buying first bot you see  
**Solution:** Compare 10-20 bots, calculate value scores

### 2. Ignoring Faction Bonuses
**Mistake:** Only looking at base rating  
**Solution:** Factor in +15 GodClass or +12 Master bonuses

### 3. Over-Racing Without Maintenance
**Mistake:** Racing with <70 condition or <50 battery  
**Solution:** Recharge before critical thresholds

### 4. Inefficient Upgrade Spending
**Mistake:** Pushing one stat to 70+ early (costs 80-170 ICP for +0-1)  
**Solution:** Spread first upgrades across multiple stats (3 parts each = great value)

**Example - Bad:**
- 6 upgrades to Speed: 3+5+8+12+18+25 = 71 parts (475 ICP!) → +8-12 total

**Example - Good:**
- 1 upgrade each to 4 stats: 3+3+3+3 = 12 parts (80 ICP) → +8-12 total
- Same total gain, 1/6th the cost!

### 5. Wrong Race Class
**Mistake:** Entering Elite races with 55-rated bot  
**Solution:** Progress through classes, build win record

### 6. Ignoring Terrain
**Mistake:** WildBot in MetalRoads sprint races  
**Solution:** Match bot strengths to race conditions

### 7. Panic Selling
**Mistake:** Selling after a few losses  
**Solution:** Give bots 20+ races to prove themselves

### 8. Upgrade During Events
**Mistake:** Upgrading when big race scheduled tomorrow  
**Solution:** Plan around calendar (12-hour lockout)
